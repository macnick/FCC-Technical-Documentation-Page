# freeCodeCamp Technical Documentation Page

This is my Technical Documentation page for freeCodeCamp's fourth [basic front end project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page) inspired by the (then) new Ducati Panigale V4. Demo is also available [on codepen.io](https://codepen.io/macnick/full/WYpKrr). This is not the complete manual of the Panigale. There is a link at the bottom of the page for the full manual.
