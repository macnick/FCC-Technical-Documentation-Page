          <h3>Safety guidelines</h3>
          <p>
            We would like to welcome you among Ducati enthusiasts, and
            congratulate you on your excellent choice of motorcycle. We think
            you will ride your Ducati motorcycle for long journeys as well as
            short daily trips. Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A. wishes you smooth and
            enjoyable riding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your motorcycle is the result of Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A.'s
            on-going research and development efforts. It is important that you
            preserve its quality standard by strictly observing the maintenance
            plan and using genuine spare parts.
          </p>
          <p>
            This manual provides instructions on minor maintenance operations.
            Major maintenance operations are described in the Workshop Manual
            available to Ducati Authorised Service Centres.
          </p>
          <p>
            In your own interest, for your safety and in order to guarantee
            product reliability, you are strongly advised to refer to our
            authorised Dealers and Service Centres for any operations listed in
            the scheduled maintenance chart, see page 311.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our highly skilled staff have access to special implements and
            appropriate equipment required to perform any servicing job at best,
            and use Ducati original spare parts only as the best guarantee for
            full interchangeability, smooth running and long life.
          </p>
          <p>
            All Ducati motorcycles come with a Warranty Card. The warranty does
            not apply to motorcycles used in racing competitions. Tampering with
            or altering any components, even partially, will make the warranty
            null and void effective immediately. Improper or poor maintenance,
            using other than original spare parts or parts not expressly
            approved by Ducati may invalidate your warranty rights and lead to
            damage or loss of performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your safety and that of other road users are very important. Ducati
            Motor Holding S.p.A. recommends that you ride responsibly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before using your motorcycle for the first time, read this entire
            manual carefully and closely follow the guidelines outlined in it.
            The manual provides full information on proper motorcycle operation
            and maintenance. In case of any doubts, please contact a Dealer or
            Authorised Service Centre.

          <h3>Running-in recommendations</h3>
          <h3>Maximum rotation speed</h3>
          <p>
            Rotation speed for running-in period and during standard use (rpm):
          </p>
          <p>1) Up to 1,000 km (621 mi);</p>
          <p>2) From 1000 km (621 mi) to 2500 km (1553 mi).</p>
          <p>Up to 1,000 Km (621 mi)</p>
          <p>
            During the first 1000 km (621.37 mi), keep an eye on the rev
            counter. It should never exceed: 5,500÷ (included) 6,000 rpm.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the first hours of riding, it is advisable to run the engine
            at varying load and rpm, though still within recommended limit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strict observance of running-in recommendations will ensure longer
            engine life and reduce the likelihood of overhauls and tune-ups.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle fa-lg"></i> During the first
            1000 km (621 mi) (Running-in period), i.e. when the Odometer
            displays a value <= (lower than or equal to) 1000 km (621 mi), the
            pre- warning area, indicated in orange (Orange area), both for the
            bargraph filling and the display of the relevant number, is
            displayed when reaching 6000 rpm. During the running-in period we
            recommend not to exceed 6000 rpm, thus the instrument panel will not
            display the bargraph "Orange area".
          </p>
          <p>
            To this end, roads with plenty of bends and even slightly hilly
            areas are ideal for a most efficient running-in of engine, brakes
            and suspensions.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the first 100 km (62 mi) use the brakes gently. Avoid sudden or
            prolonged braking. This will allow the friction material on the
            brake pads to bed in against the brake discs.
          </p>
          <p>
            For all mechanical parts of the motorcycle to adapt to one another
            and above all not to adversely affect the life of basic engine
            parts, it is advisable to avoid harsh accelerations and not to run
            the engine at high rpm for too long, especially uphill.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, the drive chain should be inspected frequently.
            Lubricate as required.

          <h3>Removing the fairing</h3>
          <p>
            To carry out some maintenance or repair operations, some motorcycle
            fairings must be removed.
          </p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle fa-lg">Warning</i></p>
          <p>
            Failed or incorrect refitting of one of the removed components could
            cause its sudden detachment while riding resulting in loss of
            control of the motorcycle.
          </p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle fa-lg">Important</i></p>
          <p>
            At every reassembly, to avoid damaging the painted areas and the
            Plexiglass windscreen, always place the nylon washers at the
            retaining screws.
          </p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle fa-lg">Important</i></p>
          <p>
            Have the fairing removal performed at a Ducati Dealer or Authorised
            Service Centre.

          <h3>Change air filter</h3>
          <p><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle fa-lg">Important</i></p>
          <p>
            Have the air filter maintenance performed at a Ducati Dealer or
            Authorised Service Centre.
          </p>
          <h3>Checking coolant level and topping up, if necessary</h3>
          <p>
            Check that coolant in the expansion reservoir is between the MIN (1)
            and MAX (2) marks on the visible sticker by removing the right
            half-fairing. Top up if the level is below the MIN mark.

              <h3>Cheking brake and clutch fluid level</h3>
              <p>

                reservoirs.
              </p>
              <p>
                If level drops below the limit, air might get into the circuit
                and affect the operation of the system involved.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fluid must be topped up and changed at the intervals specified
                in the scheduled maintenance table reported in the Warranty
                Booklet; please contact a Ducati Dealer or authorised Service
                Centre.

              <h3>Brake system</h3>
              <p>
                If you find exceeding clearance on brake lever or pedal and
                brake pads are still in good condition, contact your Ducati
                Dealer or authorised Service Centre to have the system inspected
                and any air drained out of the circuit.
              </p>
              <p><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle fa-lg">Warning</i></p>
              <p>
                Brake and clutch fluid can damage paintwork and plastic parts,

            This scheduled maintenance chart is designed for a road use of the
            Panigale V4. If it is used on the track, even if not during sport
            competitions, all parts of the motorcycle are more stressed so the
            routine maintenance operations must be carried out more frequently
            than indicated.
          </p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle fa-lg">Warning</i></p>
          <p>
            Please contact a Ducati Dealer or authorised Service Centre where
            you can receive customised service advice according to the sport use
            you make of your Panigale V4.
